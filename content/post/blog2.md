# Hello Friends,
this is **Sahil Sawant**, and today I am going to tell you some amaizing **LINUX UTILITIES** to use...

## For Newbies,
A thing I have observed a lot is that, a lot of newbies are afraid of LINUX Terminals, and avoid using them.
Actually, drastically shifting from Windows Environment is the main problem, as the newbies are not well-equiped with the DARK-TERMINALS, and prefer using GUI applications.

So, Here are my few suggestions for starting off with few of the basic applications. ......


# 1. Ranger :

Now, the first one on our list is the **RANGER** .
It is the terminal file manager with text based User Interfacefor Unix-like Systems.
This program can accompalish file management tasks with few key-strokes, and mouse input is optional.
It uses the **VIM** key-bindings. i.e. here, you can navigate using the arrow keys.
Obviously, ther are also few addons, but for a newer stage, those will not be necessary.
